# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds

### Programming Project
* [Intro to Python Project - Classifying Pet Images:] Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.

This project is part of Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree.

Here, I used a created image classifier to identify dog breeds.

## Dependencies

The project has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
